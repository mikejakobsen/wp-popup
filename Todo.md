- [ ] PHP: Detech Mobile Device. Screenwidth or Device based?!
- [ ] JS: Show popup
- [ ] JS: Inline styling the template
- [ ] WP-core: Add plugin entry in the backend

### Thoughts

The template has to be a part of the *.php*, wordpress can't interact with *.js*.

### Feature request

- [ ] JS: Show after.. 5, 10 sec?
- [ ] PHP: Choose layout
